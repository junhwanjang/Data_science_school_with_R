company,review
Nordstrom,"It is more expensive than most stores, but the customer service is great."
Nordstrom,"I love NORDYS! If for any reason you have a problem with your purchase, you can return with no questions asked! Also if there was a mistake on their part they will either give you a gift card or send you out a new item. That is great customer service!!!"
Nordstrom,"My daughter and I went to the pre-sale at Nordstrom Bellevue last night and it was busy and chaotic. We shopped in several departments, one being shoes. We were just looking for workout shoes for my daughter when we met Tyler, a very friendly, charismatic young salesclerk. He showed my daughter several pairs of workout shoes and several?heels. It was towards closing time and Tyler was still helpful and bringing items out. He gave good product knowledge and also offered us water, so nice after a long hot day. It was a refreshing experience, he cared about our needs and gave us many choices. We ended up buying two pair of workout shoes, 1 pair heels, and a non sale pair of flip-flops. Wow four pairs of shoes and we may go back for boots. Tyler made the difference and was very patient!!! If you go into Nordstrom for shoes visit Tyler you won't be disappointed!"
Nordstrom,I have made two purchases on nordstrom.com and no problems encountered. Both items (a pair of sandals and a business style dress) were as described and arrived on time. Not cheap but not too expensive so I'm happy to recommend.
Nordstrom,"As I live in a small town with very few good stores, Nordstrom is one of my favorite sites for many dresses. I've bought 3 dresses there so far. A little bit expensive sometimes but nice selection and good customer service."
Nordstrom,"I swear that the whole process for the order is screwed up. Took 11 working days and the item was not even shipped (till date). This lady (Kayla) work behind the desk learn to console customer but it just ain't helping it at all, well, basically she just like to bs with you and beat around the bush. Screw this NordStrom, I swear this will?be the first and last time getting gifts from here. My fault not to read online reviews before purchase, if anyone buying from here please avoid if not read more review about this $#*!ty site."
Nordstrom,"I bought a joseph abboud long coat that cost $600 about 3 years and the material around the button was tearing . I was with sales and sales manager at woodfield mall in Schaumburg , IL and they offered a card for outside tailor and after telling how much I spend me and immediate family and friends spend they called their tailor and he said?he can threaded but it will show. No help their and sales manager insulted by telling I bought at Nordstrom Rack , so what , great service always , but not this time. First time I felt Nordstrom have hired the wrong people."
Nordstrom,"One of my favorite places to purchase neat stuff! I had to wait a long time though for shipment but other than that, great!"
Nordstrom,"I placed an online order for a Nicole Miller dress, and it was processed and everything. Only to get an email later to say the order was cancelled because their system basically orders more than what is actually in stock. I spent over a month looking for a dress for my ten year wedding anniversary only to get a mere ""apologies,"" an NO type?of compensation whatsoever KNOWING that there's obviously a glitch in their system. Very BAD customer service Nordstrom! I expected better from you guys."
Nordstrom,"I ordered jimmy choo pumps for my wedding worth $700 and I received used pair. I called Nordstrom, they apologized and told me they will send me a brand new pair but they have to charge for the second pair until they get the old pair back. I told them I could not spend $1400 on shoes in one week. After a long hold the lady gave me 30 days?to return the old one without additional $700. She told me she will inspect this pair to make sure that nobody wore them. Today I finally got my second pair of shoes and they look even worse. Honestly, it is like a bad joke. I wish I can post pictures here. They look used and abused. I'm so tired of Nordstrom. That woman lied to me!"
Nordstrom,"Ordered my first jumpsuit after losing weight on Nordstrom, which came of the wrong size. I really wonder if the Nordstrom people actually check the product they pack and ship!! Called them for replacement and exchange, which was first refused. They did agree to a refund though!! If any of you is thinking of Nordstrom, please avoid this website.?Too many products, which is why they mess it big time. I ordered for a spring dress on the same day on another website, FSession, and this time I am more than surprised. What perfect packaging and cool shipping in less than three days!"
Nordstrom,"i made shopping from nordstrom.com, i got accept my request in 5 days its such and hard to sit tight for this much time and additionally its so much exorbitant i discovered each items , i have been exp. to buy a percentage of the denim pants from fsession.com they are much superior to those."
Nordstrom,"""Terrible, call them 5 times and yet didn't received the right thing."" on the other side love fsession.com. yeah they are much better than that!!"
Nordstrom,I used this site before its was a good shopping experience. They got a really wide verity of ugg boots love it.
Nordstrom,"Worst customer service on the phone and online. I bought a coat fro almost $300. 5 minutes later I got an email saying they were sorry, the coat wasn't in stock anymore. They said my credit card wasn't charge. Days later I checked my bank account and found out they had my money on hold and it takes up to 5 days for them to put back on my account.?Why do they hold my money if they know the coat wasn't in stock and I'm not getting it. I called customer service. They were very rude over the phone. This is the last time I buy from Nordstrom."
Dillard's,"i was just fired today by a group of managers mr dewey and my manager karen , what i never got is what happened to the day i was physically and verbally played with.? i was sick and was told by my manager to hurry and work fast , ok........im sick, so i asked to go home, when it became a verbal argument i tried to call the store manager?in which point my shoe manager slammed the phone and tried to rip out the cord, now few months later they tell my my sales goals are not good enough and i need to go asap even followed me outside like an idiot. where is the video you denied me of when when slammed the phone on me that i asked for for my attorney? why would you kick me out like an animal although i was just walking to clock out. and why would you blame sales when we got 4 new people and you waited till its slow season to rid of me, one thing is i want a lawyer to get that video and show the world what you do. you fired a hard worker and an honest one but most of all you verbally and physically abused me, and that you need to get fired for. no empleyee should go through your games and torture"
Dillard's,Yesterday's fashions at Dillard's...
Dillard's,"Dillards has Ten Star products both online and in store. I have shopped the stores while on business and they have great quality items. I take stars away for the shipping, return shipping cost, and the failure to have coupon codes often. I have never had an issue with Dillards ( I used a coupon code and had no need to return) as they often?have limited edition items which only Dillards carries. However, the coupon code made the sale possible other wise the item would have cost an additional 11.95 and returns are on you. Macy's and others make online shopping with Dillards not necessary- as they are much better with shipping cost and returns. I will continue to shop brick and mortar Dillards and only online with codes. Sale prices are not the best as Dillards is not a competitive in pricing."
Dillard's,"Like TN said, they have great shoe sales. Having bought a pair of shoes from endless that fit well, I found another of the same style but in different colours on dillards and ordered them. They charge about $8 shipping but if you're sure of the style and fit, it's a good deal. I had to change the address after the order was processed and?usually I've never been able to have a retailer successfully do that, but dillards was able to. Very impressed! Their customer service was also extremely helpful and timely."
Dillard's,"OMG the handbags you can get on this site in the sales and clearance category!!They carry Fossil, Steve Madden, BCBG,Lucky, Gianni B, KVZ, Jessica Simpson, The Sak, etc. They are actually having a great sale today 40% off sale and clearance 07/28/11...The only reason for 3 stars? The shipping is pretty expensive.Must see this site!!"
Dillard's,Usually if I cannot find what I am looking for at Macys.com I am sure to find it at Dillards.com. I have gotten some really good deals from them from dresses to jackets. They are a very reputable company and sell designer quality items. I have never had a problem with any of the purchases from Dillards both in the store and online. This is?a very good clothing store.
Kohl's,"Everytime I use the Kohl's website i have a problem. Most times Kohl's customer service department doesn't care at all. When they sent out my birthday coupon it wasn't attached, their reply was oh well we can't replace it, let your post office know. I think they don't care about their customers at all and the quality of their merchandise?is just fair."
Kohl's,"In general, I'm pleased with the site. It's a great alternative to going to the store when the weather is awful. I have ordered merchandise a few times and it has arrived in the expected time. One problem (why it's not 5 stars) is that the rendering of colors on their website could be better. I ended up having to do a return and repurchase of bath rugs because the actual color as it appears in the store or on my bathroom floor was slightly different than the online version. I didn't have any hassles on the return, but I did end up paying for shipping twice."
Kohl's,Bought a shoe online for my boyfriend for last Christmas and it was so worth it! Shoe quality was great & shipping was even a day early!! Will buy in store and online again !!
Kohl's,"Love the site!!! There are at least more than 2 items in every room which are from Kohl's in my house now. And there are certain things I just go straight to kohl's to shop for, like bedding. Best after shopping all over the places. love it!"
Kohl's,I love Kohls but I am UNIMPRESSED with the Kohls cash =( If you use your cash online and decide you want to return the merchandise at the store.. they will NOT give the full refund!! Only a small portion of it or you can go try to find something in the store for the Exact value of the item! What a PAIN! I wandered around and around in the store trying to find something for that amount! Finally I just settled on something I didn't really want! They should refund the purchase for the exact amount as the receipt!
Kohl's,They always will take returns and no questions. Love Kohls Cash
Kohl's,I love Kohl's website. Its easy to navigate and I 'm able to find what I'm looking for quickly. Kohls website and the stores are 2 of my favorite places to shop.
Kohl's,I LOVE Kohls. They have great sales online. They only problem is their site is slow sometimes AND I have lost my shopping bag several times. Also I've deleted items only for them to re-appear when I log back in. They really need to update their website.
Kohl's,"I ordered a pair of boots online Dec 18 they never showed up and had to cancel and reorder Dec 31 and its Jan 10 and called they said they had to cancel again with no answers where the boots went. I finally cancelled the order and will never, never order another item online."
Kohl's,"I LOVE Kohls. They have great deals. I usually order online instead of going in the store, and everything always arrives on time and well packaged. I have had to return things to the store a couple of times (I just didn't like the way the clothes looked on me), and never had any issues."
Kohl's,"Prices are usually not the best, but if you combine discount codes than they're ok. Shipping is usually fast, except during the holidays, but they are aware of it so they send out an email to let customers know. The last time they emailed me a $25 coupon because I had not received my things by the date that they had promised. Customer service?is usually great"
Kohl's,Customer service during holidays is non-existent. Canceled half of my order 2 weeks before Christmas (when it was purchased over 3 weeks ago) and never shipped the other half! On hold forever and a day to reach someone who cannot give you an answer anyway!
Kohl's,Ordered items on line two weeks ago and still cannot find out if they have been shipped or if I am going to get my orders. customer service is a joke because they seem to not have any kind of tracking information. I am really upset don't know if I should try to spend another $100.00 to buy from another store.
Kohl's,Ordered a Christmas toy in November. Kohls contacts me 2 weeks before Christmas and tell am they cancelled my order. Now it's impossible to find this toy!! They ruined a child's Christmas!!
Kohl's,"As many know kohls had their Black Friday sale the entire week of thanksgiving. I decided to get some shopping out of the way and purchase luggage online from kohls Tuesday the 26th. Hours later I get an email saying they cannot process the order I spend a great deal of time creating. Then, I try again Thursday and everything is fine until Sunday when they say 1 of the 2 luggage items I purchased is sold out. WHY DID YOU LET ME PURCHASE IF YOUR SOLD OUT?!?!? Furious I wrote kohls online. If I would have know my order wouldn't be fulfilled I would have purchased elsewhere. Kohls customer service online basically told me oh well. Then, this week I get another email saying the other luggage is sold out. What's the point of shopping at kohls If 2 weeks later I'm going to find out none of my items that i already paid for are in stock ?!? Worst customer service ever. Stay away from kohls!!"
J.C. Penney,"Have had two online shopping experiences that sucked. One about a month ago purchased a bathing suit top. 2 weeks prior to going on vacation. Had it shipped to store so I could get it in 4-7 days per internet instructions, not including the weekend. I know that. Called the store on day 7 and was told we don't get a shipment for another 8 days. Nice. Should of mailed it to my house. NOT. Last week ordered a suit for my daughter and decided this time to pay for shipping to house and yet again. Jcpenny is dropping the ball on customer service. It took them 1 hour to say order is processed and the next day shipped. Today I look online for tracking and my bank and nothing. I get an email this am and find out they didn't process the order for 5 days. 1 bathing suit, 5 days to process and 5 days to get shipped out. Done with online ordering. They need to get their acts together due to even Walmart can ship faster and process stuff faster. Boy even the gap store shipped my order in a total of order and process and ship in less then 8 days. Total with everything. WAke up Jcpenny or you'll continue to go down the tubes customer and fininical wise."
J.C. Penney,My shipping got to me on time and quality of clothes was worth it!! Will buy again in store and online!!
J.C. Penney,"My father works at the warehouse so I get 25% off all products so that's a plus in my book, very good clothes :)) love them.."
J.C. Penney,Love buying on JCP.COM. There are many ways to save using coupon codes. Everyone loves to save money !
J.C. Penney,"I haven't been inside a JC Penney store in years but I do still buy basics from their online store. Teeshirts, underwear, Pjs, socks, bathrobes, towls, sheets. Now that I think of it I really buy a lot from JC Penney. I kind of still love it."
J.C. Penney,"It is very convenient to shop from jc penney online. They have great prices and sales. Shipping was fast, and I was really happy with the clothes I bought."
J.C. Penney,"Love everything about this store! Great prices, great customer service, tons of variety. It doesn't get much better than this."
J.C. Penney,"A little hard to navigate and find what it is you are looking for, but they sure do have a lot of stuff! Over all it was pretty good"
J.C. Penney,"I've been shopping at Penney's since I was swaddled...lifelong customer. Was especially beloved in the 80's when buying school clothing, and I still miss the Big Book and holiday catalog. OK, yes, we all shop online now¡¦ I thought the outrage over their new 'everyday pricing' was a bit silly, if the prices would be as good as what?anyone could manage with a coupon. What I've noticed since the change is : NO MORE OUTLET (bummer) and the online inventory - where did it go? There isn't half what they used to have...click on an item, and it is only available in one or two sizes instead of the full range. If only a few things, no big deal...but while trying to select something for either myself or my daughter - I couldn't. Nothing I wanted was in my size or hers. She's a kiddo 7-8, and I'm a Medium. Geesh. I hope this situation improves, because I've always appreciated the sort of things I could purchase from Penney's at a reasonable price, knowing I COULD purchase it from Penney's...now, not so much."
J.C. Penney,Awesome service-Awesome value-Awesome sales. What more can you say about a company that has been in business for 110 years next April 2012? Happy Shopping!!!
J.C. Penney,I bought twice from the onlinestore (jeans and shirts). They were processing my orders fast and shipped the whole thing within one business day. Customer service was very helpful and did reply within 12 hours after my inquiry. I am certainly going to shop there again.
J.C. Penney,Great customer service. Package was stolen from doorstep & they refunded/replaced all items promptly.
Target,When I just go to the store the service is actually great there.
Target,"Target.com has been investigated by LegitScript, a NABP recognized organization that vets online pharmacies and has been given ""legitimate"" status."
Target,They shipped to my old address how can this happened ! I provided new address. They didn't care to help me. FedEx have the same customer service . I will never order or buy from target again just because what they put me thru. They told me to go and get the pkg where it was delieved and have a nice day. I can't believe such a company have this kind of costumer service.
Target,"The worst store by far. Do not shop at this store. They have no customer service, and are very rude and obnoxious. The front line lead name Darius should go back to school and learn how to treat customers. Shop at Walmart, stay away from this Target in Inglewood Ca."
Target,Target online is the worst service I have ever seen. I ordered a futon for my daughter 5/11/2014 and still have not received it 6/23/2014 after numerous calls and poor customer service. They lost the sofa multiple times (it is bigger than a breadbox) and could not locate it. I will never ever buy anything from either Target online or Target stores
Target,"I bought some goods online was informed that email would be sent to enable me pick up from stores after 5hrs of the order made .No email received .was informed that my other order would be delivered by the 06/09/2014. No email was received whatsoever about my order.Contacted the store after 48hours only to be informed some of my order was no longer available. Order would no longer be delivered on 06/09/2014 rather it would be delivered on 06/12/14.and nothing could be done to expedite the order cos it in transit.no apologises offered for there incompetences rather I should contact the courier company myself and deal with the matter myself.,which I find very inefficient and up adequate for a big company like Target..the purpose for the purchase was a birthday gift for a visiting family from UK to give to there Children,however due to the inefficiency of the Target services and unhelpful customer services . I was not able to send the gift because the goods would be arriving after the family have travelled back.I am so disgusted at the way they offer there service
Based on this experience I would never buy anything from this company or recommend them to anyone.And if I come across people who want to purchase from them I would do everything possible to discourage them from purchasing from the company."
Target,Worst customer service ever! I ordered a crib from Target.com for a baby shower gift and what arrived was a book shelf. I asked cs if he can issue a call tag for UPS to pick up the package since it was 65 lbs which I can't carry to a local UPS store. they said no and basically couldn't do anything to help except email a return label and order it again on the website which the process will take another month. All I wanted was target to fix the issue in a quick reasonable time but they could care less. I ordered the gift a month ahead before the event and now I have to look elsewhere.
Target,"I like target. It¡¯s one of my favorite stores, but the red card is a scam. It¡¯s marketed as a no fee debit card that comes right out of your account. What I assume with a debit card is that they check your balance then they authorize the transaction. If you have money or overdraft your approved otherwise your declined. Worst case you owe your back money for the overdraft protection. When you use your Target ¡°debit¡± card you are writing a check. It will be presented to your bank several days later. If it doesn¡¯t clear Target will charge you $30 and your bank may charge you the same, but you have also just written a hot check and can be arrested and charged with a misdemeanor.. and they could report you to the check systems as a hot check writer. What? They failed to mention this. The banks can't do this anymore without your permission on debit cards. Target can because they are not a bank. Yes it did happen to me, except the reporting part. Three red card transactions all less than 3$ they charged me $90. Oh but they ran the transactions again and they all cleared, so I didn't owe the 5$ just the 90$ fee. Shop target just stay away from the red card."
Target,"Absolutely terrible in every way. I purchased an item online and picked it up in the store. There was a promotion for a $25 gift card with the purchase. I never received the gift card so I called the customer service #. I was put on hold for over 20 minutes then the line went dead, this happened three times. I finally got someone and was told they would reissue it. It never came. I have now called a total of SEVEN times, its been two months and I still don't have the gift card. Never ever again will I purchase anything from Target online and I now try to avoid the store as well. Very disappointing."
Target,"I purchased an item, making sure it was going to send to my current address and when I went to track it a few days later, it had it going to an old address that isn't even on file anymore. I called customer service and all they could tell me was that they would give me a refund or I can call Fedex and have it re-routed. So of course I was pissed because I was going to have to pay extra shipping charges to have it re-routed, but I did not want to wait 7-10 days for my refund only to have to order it again. So I called Fedex and what do they tell me? I have to call Target because they cannot re-route the package for me!!!! I absolutely hate Target now because of this horrible experience I have had with them. How can they ship it to the wrong address when my default address that I have on file is the current address? I specifically checked and double checked to make sure my order was correct before placing it. So none of this was consumer error. It was a system error that is now going to inconvenience me from getting my package on time and having to deal with a headache of simply just placing an online order. Not to mention not knowing if my registry items were sent to the right address!! I HATE TARGET"
Target,"I ordered some items for a beach trip from the website. The delivery was estimated at 3-5 days. I placed the order 14 days before leaving. I got an email that one of the 2 packages for the order was delivered on the 18th. Today is the 20th and still no package. I called the the phone number provided, and spoke to a representative that was condescending and the opposite of helpful. I am leaving tomorrow morning for the beach so if the items actually do arrive, they will be useless. Hopefully they do though, because then I can at least get my money back. Otherwise, I was informed that I will just have to eat the cost of the items in the package that was supposed to have been delivered but was not. I will never spend a dime at Target again."
Target,"Just for having red card, I get free shipping on everything! I don't why it's offered, but I like it! Up & up diapers are go-to diapers for me now. It's cheaper on line than in store, at least some times, I don't why but love it!"
Sears,Bought a mattress and box spring with a 10yr warranty.You have to jump through hoops to get them to approve the warranty they have guidelines and when finely they approve the won't bring you out a new mattress same brand but they tell the customers well this is what you spent now this is your credit and it is up to the customer to do the research to find a mattress equivalent to the one that was purchased it they can't switch out your mattress then they should not be selling them.I heard from one of their sales persons that each mattress is made when ordered well make me a new one just better.
Sears,"They take pains to resolve customer complaints in a fair way. I was overcharged (Sears is a big bureaucracy and does make mistakes). I complained and their representative did a careful job of collecting the facts. In the end, I did not agree with their conclusion, but I have never seen a big company take such pains to do the right thing. Some companies will easily yield to customer complaints (good PR; helps keep customers loyal), and other companies will never give an inch, once they have your money. Sears is willing to employ people to make the fairest, most reasonable resolution of customer complaints."
Sears,"This web site is broken in so many places it's obvious that they do little to no QA whatsoever. When I login to the primary ""ShopYourWay"" site and try to update my account details, I receive a ""cannot send message."" (WTF?) When I login to the Sears credit card site and try to add a mobile phone number, the page validates the phone number as if it were an email address! Pathetic (I wish I could post a snapshot of this blatant error). It's amazing the Sears web site handles purchases at all."
Sears,"If anything goes wrong with your product Sears is a horror to deal with. I have never seen such terrible customer service. I was put on hold and transferred for three hours, none of the people I talked to could help. During this time I was hung up on three times while they were transferring my call and the whole process would start again. The only way that I ever got help was complaining online which got me assigned to a case manager. Just avoid the hassle and order from somewhere else."
Sears,"Beware of Sears.com if the item is fulfilled by a ""marketplace"" vendor. One month after I was charged I still have no shipment and no refund from Sears.com or HNZONE (their 3rd party vendor). 2 emails and 3 calls to customer service have not worked yet, only that they are ""researching"" the order. The review on their site is being ""reviewed"", but the truth will be shown here."
Sears,"I ordered a pair of gloves and got received only one glove. It took me 3 months and a lot of phone calls and emails to get my refund. They used 3rd party warehouse to send this item. I think that was a scam, done on purpose so customer after a long time of fighting for many would give up and they win. If you are trining to order online through sears.com try it be delivered to store, not straight to your house. worse comes to worst, you can blame the store and write afeedback on google maps. I bet they would be pist off."
Sears,"Ordered a drive pulley for a Whirlpool washer. (from Sears) They said they had it. Paid and waited. Three days later they sent email, cannot get it. They sell the washer. Went to amazon and ordered. Got it in 2 days. For 1/3 the cost. Again amazon has been the best site for getting products. At lease Sears did a refund to my credit card in 2-3 days. Partselect.com which I used first, I'm still waiting for a refund from 10-20-2013. They are the worst site to buy from."
Sears,"I purchased the full retail version of Microsoft Office Professional 2010 from EWPLUSOFT via the Sears Marketplace. You really want to avoid purchasing software from EWPLUSOFT since they provide developer's licenses rather than retail licenses (called Office Professional Plus 2010). Microsoft will not activate developer licenses without a developer's subscription. I have no idea of the cost this subscription since I am a home user. I sent 8 e-mails asking EWPLUSOFT for a disc with the retail version of the software or a full refund. EWPLUSOFT sent 7 e-mails simply telling me that I needed to download the software from their website ""to fix the problem"" in lieu of retail disc. In the 8th e-mail, EWPLUSOFT finally acknowledged that they will neither provide a disc with the retail version of Microsoft Office Professional 2010 nor provide a refund. Again, you really want to avoid doing business this Marketplace seller!"
Sears,good and cheap too.
Sears,"worst costumer service. The only warehouse website that I have seen crashing during my order, I could not even log in for a long time after that.."
Macy's,"I ordered a number of items from Macy's recently. Not all of the items were immediately available, so I received my items bit by bit, but the final delivery was received within three days of the first delivery. Macy's could have just held my items until they were all ready (since the time between delivery of the first and final items was negligible) but went ahead and shipped them as they were ready. Macy's delivery time is always speedy!"
Macy's,"Macys costumer service is HORRIBLE!! Just totally horrid!!! 
I¡¯m an Australian buyer, bought a bag online from Macys, 10 days after not even receiving a shipping confirmation email decided to email contact them. Few hours later they got back with the most appalling reply! Telling me my order got cancelled (and they didn¡¯t even let me know that it got cancelled). The thought that the item was out of stock, but then they found out they have more of the same item in stock, so told me to re order! Yes let me just spend more money $$$ whilst the money I already spent on the bag is withheld. They didn¡¯t even apologize for the inconvenienced they caused me. Pretty much they explained in a bad manner what went wrong and ¡®¡¯HOW I HAVE TO FIX IT¡¯¡¯. Instead of fixing the problem themselves, ¡®¡¯let me see maybe send me the bag now that you have it in stock¡¯¡¯. But no instead they informed me that I have to re order it spend more $$$ and time and then have to go contact their partners to get my money back for the bag spent which is withheld and which will take few weeks to get back. I online shop a lot , If something goes wrong with the order most other companies acknowledge what they did wrong, i.e by actually contacting me and telling me that the order is cancelled, they either fix the problem and if they cannot they would refund the money and apologize, give me a voucher or discount codes for the inconvenience caused. I will never shop at Macys again thats for sure, they receive 0 stars for their customer service. I am still very shocked!"
Macy's,"Decent offerings and sorting make this site a once or twice a month shopping experience. Their preview of merchandise is not always clear on differences between similar products (pants, for example). Their sales codes are always spot on (when these don't work elsewhere, it troubles me). Link to your account for easy checkout. All and all, a good experience. Prices can be high sometimes and wish the clearance section was larger."
Macy's,Great store great site
Macy's,Shopping on macys.com is a pleasure. They have a great variety of items to choose from and many search options that make it easier for the user to find exactly what they need.
Macy's,"I'm not going to lie, customer service in general is usually aggravating, especially when you don't/can't get the answer you are hoping for. I dealt with maces.com yesterday about a misunderstanding when applying for the credit card - they typically offer 20% off - so i decided to buy my wife a burberry purse. There is no fine print that mentions what items are excluded in that 20% - of course, burberry is one of them. I called up customer service, very upset, and although they could not offer the discount on the purse, they sent me a coupon for 20% off another item - which is a nice gesture. I understand it's a store policy, and the agent was extremely nice, but my only gripe is that they should at least have an exclusions list."
Macy's,"I missed a sale yesterday and they honored the sale price after a lengthy call with customer service today. They were extremely helpful and polite! I was hesitant to call, but I'm very glad I did!"
Macy's,I shop at Macys quite often and I love their special deals and sales but if you need something to be delivered fast I wouldn't recommend their online shop. Sometimes it takes up to a week for them to process the order and waiting for the delivery can be pretty annoying. Otherwise I like the service.
Macy's,"When looking for a specific Movado watch, the website states it was a man's watch, however, when I went to buy it at the store, I stated again that I was looking for this particular watch for my husband. They found it, I bought it, brought it home, it didn't fit my husband. Turns out, they had mislabeled the watch both in their store and on their website, and when I went to the actual Movado website, the watch is a women's small. Way to get a sale idiots."
Macy's,"Was clued in by my gf, who tries to get me to smoke crack, that macy's is overpriced. Not as overpriced as crack! I went in to get a duvet cover, and I asked him how much a quilted grey cover cost... he scanned and then said $325. I said ""that is a little more than I want to spend."" He then said something about it being ""Ralph Lauren."" Must be popular in certain circles."
Macy's,"Horrific experience. Worst customer service. Impossible to get through. ""On hold"" for over ONE HOUR as they were trying to figure out a mistake on a refund check they mailed me. The mistake was entirely an error on their part! The tone and attitude of the highest level representative I asked to speak to was dismissive and accusatory as though it were my fault. Unforgettably awful experience. A fraud of an operation."
Macy's,I've shopped there from time to time. Now I know why Macys is called Americas' favorite department store.
Macy's,Canceled my order 3 times i had rush delivery for christmas. the worst customer service and fraud department ever. i would never shop online or at the store ever again. over 600$ taken out of my card and they wanted another form of payment. they are joke.
Wal-Mart,I feel I am paying a reasonable price for what I buy from walmart and I feel secure by their return policy.
Wal-Mart,"Wal-Mart in Dunn, N.C. has the longest wait time to check out. There pharmacy has charged me a different price for the same medicine 3 times from 65.00 to 36.00. When I asked why they said it must be a different company that they got their medicine from humm whatever they charge what they want to seems like. I had my oil changed there while shopping got almost home and the oil light came on. Checked my oil and it was empty. Now my car knocks thanks Wal-Mart for over charging me for my medicine, wasting my time standing in long lines with only 4 people running a register and lastly for blowing up my car!!!!"
Wal-Mart,"Excellent service. Very fast response. I bought a very competitively priced safe which stopped working in two days. Walmart got someone to pick up the item in less than a day before I even had a chance to package it. The delivery service came back the next day and I got my replacement within a 10 day period. And the replacement works.
If you research the item you want to buy and you can find it on Walmart, Walmart is the most competitive price wise, especially for heavy items. Price-wise, Amazon is second but Amazon offers the widest array of choices, Ebay is not at all competitive for large heavy weight items."
Wal-Mart,"Wal-Mart sold me a desktop, refurb, Dell Optiplex GX 620, which gives me a message, Build 7601, Windows 7 Not genuine, an its not working correctly, my cell for text or calls is 713 502 7706, Wal-Mart.Com is not responding too my phone calls about this, nor my e mails, they put me on hold, til the phone system times out.

Wal-Mart,"Recently I had a prescription filled by Walmart pharmacy. When I got home, I discovered they had given me a wrong medication (one for seizures VS one for restless legs). I had to take that medication back, was not re=imbursed; was told my medication had not been ordered; went back again to find out they had the wrong type of the correct medication; had to wait until they got the correct one in, drive back over to the store. All in all, I wasted gas 3 times to get the medication, wasted my time, could have harmed myself if I had taken the wrong medication. I was ignored when I asked to speak to the store manager. I wrote to the corporate office - whom 2 weeks later has not contacted me. I had been a customer for almost 30 years of Walmart, but they seem to have no loyalty nor concern for their customers. I am done with them."
Wal-Mart,"Purchased a Straighttalk 3 month card to apply to my husbands cell phone. Code for me to enter onto his phone to activate the card was to be sent to my email immediately. Never received the code. Had to buy a card from Straighttalk to keep from losing service. Walmart's excuse was that I had changed my password on my account a week previously so it put my order on hold. Amazing...I ordered a Pressure Cooker at the time I changed my password and it was delivered to my house in 3 days,. Walmart took the money for the cell phone card from Paypal, and I had to get everything cancelled, which was a huge hassle."
Wal-Mart,"Love how your banner says "" we've got your summer fun"". You do have my summer fun and its sitting in your warehouse somewhere. On July 11th I went to walmart.com and bought a 10'x30"" metal frame pool. Delivery was supposed to be by 7/23. 7/23 came and no pool. Called ups and was told they would investigate where my package is. Called walmart to see if they could ship me a new one and was told there are none in stock and nobody knows when they will be in stock. I was told I (not walmart) had to check their website everyday and once one was in stock I had to let walmart know and they would rush deliver it to me. Last time I checked I didn't work for walmart so not sure why this was my responsibility and not the responsibility of a walmart employee. On 7/26 I checked your website and found a 12'x30"" pool on sale for the same price I paid for mine. I called walmart and asked if they could just rush deliver that pool to me since it was the same price and nobody would be out any extra money. I was told no. Was told that would be breaking the rules and that I would have to request a refund (that takes 7 business days) and purchase the second pool. I advised that I would not be able to purchase the second pool until after I got my refund and I was worried the pool would be gone before then. I advised that I thought my suggestion was a simple solution to make a customer happy. I asked for a supervisor and the person put me on hold and came back and told me they would not ship me the available pool. Asked for the supervisor again and was told none were available. Told her that was incorrect as she had just put me on hold to talk to a supervisor. I was told I had to wait 24-48 hours for a call back. I tried to explain that I have a job where I cant answer the phone at work. that got me no results. In subsequent phone calls I have been told walmart employees can not make outbound phone calls so no one could call the warehouse and have thme ship me the available pool. ( which was out of stock by 7/28). I've been told refunds take 7 days total or 7 business days. And to top it all off I was told by UPS today that they did not lose my package. they told me they never picked the package up because walmart NEVER SHIPPED MY PACKAGE. Thanks for stringing me along for a week and blaming UPS when all this time you knew you never shipped it. Thanks for turning down my suggestion for a simple solution that would have made the customer happy. Thanks for ""having my summer fun"" Glad you have it and not me since I was the paying customer. I know what I bought wasn't a real high priced item but I always though walmart was a store for the average hard working person. Guess I was wrong"
Wal-Mart,"I have a question. If I bought a computer on Walmart.com and it was dysfunctional and picked it up at a Walmart in the next town over, can I return it to my local Walmart or do I need to go back to the Walmart I picked it up at?"
Wal-Mart,"This review is to thank Walmart.com for being so proactive to stop someone from fraudulently using my credit card. A few weeks ago I received a call asking if I'd placed an order with Walmart.com. I hadn't. The rep couldn't provide any particulars on 'what' was ordered, but could say that it was to be shipped to Huntington Beach, CA. I knew neither I, nor my girls who also use my cc hadn't done that. Walmart.com prevented the charge from going through on my account as well as alerted me that someone else was using my cc number. I followed up with my bank to close that cc account. 
I'm not sure what about the transaction alerted Walmart.com to contact me, but I'm really thankful that they did. "
Wal-Mart,"I oredered an fs18 bmx 18"" wheel bike---order#2677027-267762. Ist email said order received; 2nd email said we have shipped bike as you requested to austin tx store for pick up by relative(I will not name). #3rd email days later said that the bike would be delayed.
4th email said review your item-tell us how you like it; NOTE: something missing here NEVER AN EMAIL CAME TO PICK UP BIKE AT STORE THAT IT HAD ARRIVED. 5th email said: we have returned bike due to failure of not being picked up. 6th email said: we have refunded paypal for cost amount. It took me almost an hour to find a way to call them, they donnot make it easy for you to phone them. Agent that answered said that I was right and that no notice was sent for pick up. I asked him, will you correct the mistake or problem that made the order a mess which is what it is. He answered no and I asked why and this could happen in future to other customers. He said that email to pick up was not sent and in other words thats that. REMINDED ME OF OBAMA-DUMBO - HIS president - I don't claim dumbo as my pres. WELL THAT IS MY REVIEW OF AN ITEM I DID NOT EVEN RECEIVE. GOOD LUCK YA'LL."
Wal-Mart,"Purchased a G.E. counter top microwave in Nov. 2012. The interior is melting paint into possibly my food. Walmart manager told me he changed the department, I checked, he pulled all G.E. microwave. The manager of Walmart will do nothing and told me to keep calling G.E. for help, they offer me $25 rebate on a new microwave that was $l59.00 my cost. Help"
Wal-Mart,My kids went to take out Passport photos in Walmart Bathurst & Centre The guy asked for 24.85 including text per 2 photos. At Costco you can get it at 5.99 at other shops you can find it at 6.99 near the passport office you can pay 8.99 This is outrages that Walmart is charging 24.85
Wal-Mart,Walmart.com says the return policy for iPods is 15 days from RECEIPT of item. I tried to return a defective iPod on day 15 and they said it is 15 days from when order was placed and refused to exchange it. This is misrepresentation and fraud.
Wal-Mart,"Very confusing return policy. Waited 15 or more minutes to get a person who had a hard time understanding what I wanted. Finally got half of the credit I deserved. Another time...got a box via FedEx....Had the wrong item in it and the right invoice...How do you start to fix this? Whole return sight not user friendly. Or, you have to spend your time taking it back to a store and hoping someone can help you."
Wal-Mart,Cheapest prices around. I bought several items online and had delivery problems with one shipment. Customer service stinks....Go to the store if you want to buy from them.
Wal-Mart,"I placed an order on Walmart.com this weekend, saw the money withdrawn from our checking account 2 times, and then received an email from Walmart that the order was cancelled. I called Walmart customer service to see what was going on. The rude man I talked to refused to refund my money even though my order had been canceled by Walmart due to a security error on their site. The customer service agent told me only way to get my money back is to contact my bank and have the bank fight for my refund which is over $200.00. The service agent also told me that my credit card information was passed onto a third party so I may want to cancel my card so someone does not drain my account. However, if I had not checked my bank account and called for help I would not have been informed of the security breach at all. My bank is going to make sure we get our money back. However, people need to know that walmart.com is not safe to shop on. They will take money out of your account and refuse to give it back. If you think I¡¯m the only person this has happened to, I am not. Just goggle walmart.com reviews and read several similar stories for yourself. Please be careful when using this website it is not safe. Needless to say we will not be giving Walmart our money anytime soon! It will take an effort not to do but I refuse to give my money to a company that is not willing to be accountable for its actions."
Wal-Mart,"How do you have customer service answer phones, only to transfer you to a phone that no one answers? Are they high!"
